I am a second-year PhD student at [CSE, Washington University in St. Louis](https://cse.wustl.edu/Pages/default.aspx). I conduct research on computer graphics and geometric computing under the supervision of [Prof. Tao Ju](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~taoju/). I am interested in applying mathematics and computation to tackle challenging problems with a geometric flavor, with applications ranging from computer animation, geometric modeling to medical imaging.

I earned my master's degree from Tsinghua University in 2018. There, I worked on remeshing with [Prof. Hui Zhang](http://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/soften/3131/2010/20101219172208224374333/20101219172208224374333_.html) and [Prof. Dong-Ming Yan](https://sites.google.com/site/yandongming/). I finished my undergraduate study in 2015 from Tsinghua University with a major in Material Science and a minor degree in Computer Science.  

Recently, I have been collaborating with [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) on a project about injective mapping and we have a [paper]({{<ref "publication/Lifting-Simplices-to-Find-Injectivity/index.md">}}) accepted to Siggraph 2020.
