# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "We present a novel isotropic surface remeshing algorithm that automatically aligns the mesh edges with an underlying directional field. The alignment is achieved by minimizing an energy function that combines both centroidal Voronoi tessellation and the penalty enforced by a six-way rotational symmetry (6-RoSy) field. The CVT term ensures the uniform distribution of thevertices and the high remeshing quality, while the field constraint enforces the directional alignment of the edges. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has the advantages of both isotropic remeshing and field-aligned remeshing. We demonstrate that our algorithm is superior to the representative state-of-the-art approaches in various aspects."
